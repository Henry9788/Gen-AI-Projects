This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application powered by Google's Gemini model and orchestrated using LangChain. It allows users to upload documents (e.g., PDFs), ask natural-language questions, and receive accurate, context-aware answers sourced directly from the uploaded content.

The app leverages semantic search and LLM reasoning to generate reliable responses grounded in your own data. It's built with a clean Streamlit interface and supports real-time Q&A over large text inputs using vector embeddings and document retrieval.

Whether you're exploring research papers, legal contracts, or business reports, this tool offers a fast and intelligent way to interact with documents — powered by the next generation of AI.
