This project demonstrates a multi-agent AI system built with the CrewAI framework to simulate collaborative web development. The system consists of three intelligent agents, each specialized in a key area of front-end and back-end web development:

Agents in the Crew
HTML Design Agent

Responsible for generating semantic and accessible HTML structure based on user input or page descriptions.

Understands layout requirements and creates clean, well-structured markup.

Handles elements like forms, navigation bars, cards, and more.

PHP Validation Agent

Validates and generates PHP logic for form handling and server-side processing.

Ensures security best practices like input validation, sanitization, and basic backend logic.

Can generate snippets for handling form submissions, user inputs, and backend responses.

CSS/Bootstrap Styling Agent

Applies responsive and modern styles to the generated HTML using plain CSS or Bootstrap classes.

Ensures visual consistency, proper layout alignment, and device adaptability.

Handles spacing, color schemes, typography, and UI enhancement using best practices.

How It Works
Built using the CrewAI framework, the system defines each agent with a specific role, toolset, and memory.

A Task is issued, and the agents collaboratively complete their part of the assignment.

LangChain (and optionally an LLM like OpenAI, Gemini, or LLaMA) powers each agent’s reasoning and response generation.

The result is a complete, styled, and partially functional web page.

Tech Stack
CrewAI: Multi-agent task coordination

LangChain: LLM framework for tool integration and agent logic

Python: Backend language orchestrating the system

LLM (e.g., ChatGPT, LLaMA, Gemini): Used for code generation

Streamlit (optional): Can be used to interact with the agents in a UI

 Example Use Case
Input: “Create a registration form with name, email, and password”
Output:

HTML agent builds the form structure

PHP agent adds validation and submission logic

CSS/Bootstrap agent styles the form for responsiveness and clarity

Potential Applications
AI-assisted front-end/back-end web generation

Educational tool for learning how HTML, PHP, and CSS interact

Rapid prototyping assistant for developers
