This project showcases how to generate and execute Python code using Meta’s LLaMA 3 model integrated with LangChain. By combining LangChain’s tool-based agent system with the Python REPL tool, the app can take natural-language prompts, generate relevant Python code, and optionally run it in a secure environment.

It’s designed for use cases like:

AI-powered coding assistants

Automated data analysis

Code explanation and generation from text prompts

With LangChain handling prompt management, agent behavior, and tool integration, and LLaMA 3 providing the reasoning and generation, this app serves as a foundation for intelligent, LLM-driven coding workflows.
